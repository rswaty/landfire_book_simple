# Biophysical Settings Descriptions


**Randy's thoughts**

* going over a BpS document is a great way to not only help people understand BpS, but also to introduce spatial datasets:
    * BpS 
    * EVT though s-class rule table (where we get lifeform)
    * EVC and EVH-rule table
    * S-class--look at succession class descriptions to understand what "A" means in an additional way (in addition to s-class table)
* demo downloading BpS descriptions
* describe key features/sections of document
* link to Blankenship et al 2021
