## What you will learn here

A foundational LANDFIRE product are the Biophysical Settings (BpS) Descriptions and Models. They set the stage for development of many LANDFIRE products such as the Biophysical Settings and Succession Class spatial datasets. On this page we will:

1.  Learn how to download all of the BpS Descriptions
2.  Learn how to download one or a set of BpS Descriptions
3.  Become familiar with:
    -   The concept of BpS and succession class
    -   How LANDFIRE documented 'reference conditions' (i.e., how our BpSs looked and functioned prior to European colonization)
    -   What is contained in the BpS descriptions
4.  Share links for further learning about BpSs and related topics

## Downloading all of the BpS descriptions

While we typically work with one or a small set of BpSs, there are times when downloading the entire set developed for the lower 48 states plus Hawaii and Alaska is most efficient.

**To download all BpS descriptions:**

1.  Navigate to [LANDFIRE's BpS Description and Quantitative Models Webpage](shttps://landfire.gov/bps-models.php){target="blank"}
2.  Scroll down to Download BpS Models and Descriptions Section (see below).
3.  Click on the "BpS Descriptions" which will trigger downloading of a .zip file named "LANDFIRE_CONUS-HI_BpS_Descriptions_Jan2023.zip" that has 819 Word Documents. This file will most likely land in your "Downloads" directory.
4.  Use your extraction tool of choice to unzip and explore. One possible way if you are using Windows is to:
    -   right click the file
    -   select 'Extract all' to access the Windows extraction tool (see below).

## Downloading one or a set of BpS documents

In support of a BpS review process we completed recently, we created a [BpS Models and Descriptions Support](https://landfirereview.org/){target="blank"} website, which has a page that allows for searching for, and downloading a single or a set of BpS Descriptions.

### Select your BpSs of interest

1.  Go to [this page](https://landfirereview.org/search.php){target="blank"} of our website.

2.  There are multiple ways to select BpS documents to download, including:

    -   Get all BpS documents by one or more broad Vegetation Types (#1 on 'Ways to select' screenshot below)
    -   Get all BpS documents by one or more LANDFIRE Map Zones (#2 on 'Ways to select' screenshot below). To get a Map Zone map you can click the "View map of LANDFIRE Map Zones" text (highlighted with blue arrow on 'Ways to download' screenshot below), or click [https://landfirereview.org/IMG/USmapzones-v1_July2015.jpg](here.){target="blank"}

<br>

```{=html}
<style>
div.blue {background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
```
::: blue
Checking boxes will select the 'Vegetation Types' and/or 'Map Zones' and/or specific BpSs for filtering or downloading purposes.
:::

<br>

Additionally, you can search for a BpS of interest by typing in the 'Search...' box(#3 on 'Ways to select' screenshot below). A few things to keep in mind when searching:

-   Genus and/or species, common or Latin (e.g., 'Fraxinus', or 'White Ash' )
-   Most text terms will work, numbers will not. For example, 'hurricane' will work return BpSs, '1362' (an actual BpS number) will not.
-   You can first filter by 'Vegetation Types' and/or 'Map Zones', then search to narrow results.

### Download documents of interest

Once you have selected the BpSs you want to get descriptions for you can take one more step to get your documents:

1.  If you want all of the BpSs for selected 'Vegetation Types' and/or 'Map Zones' you will click the 'Download All Search Results Documents' button (indicated with arrow on 'Download all' screenshot below).
2.  If you have checked specific BpSs for download, you will click the 'Download All Selected Documents' button (inidcated with an arrow on 'Download selected' screenshot below).

*Clicking either of the 'Download' buttons will initiate download of a .zip file that will most likely land in your 'Downloads' folder. See 'Windows extraction tool being used to unzip all BpS descriptions file' screenshot above for an example of how to unzip.*

<br>

```{=html}
<style>
div.yellow {background-color:#fbff87; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
```
::: yellow
Beware when clicking the 'Download All Search Results Documents' button. If not careful you will end up with a huge download of many more documents than you want! Make sure to filter by 'Vegetation Types' and/or 'Map Zones' first.

## What's in a BpS document

Once you download and unzip your selected BpS documents, what do you actually have?  One or more Word documents that in very general terms describe how the ecosystems of the US 'looked and functioned' prior to European colonization. We hope the documents are largely self-explanatory.  That said, below we'll highlight a few important considerations when reading these documents.

### File name, Map Zones and that number at the top

The BpS documents were saved with a numeric code such as "13700_60_63_64_65_66.docx".  This number represents three things: 

1. BpS code: this is the first 4 digits, e.g., "1370" in our example for the "Appalachian (Hemlock-)Northern Hardwood Forest". 
2. BpS splits: this is the fifth digit, or "0" in our example.  Occasionally an original BpS would be 'split' into multiple.  For example, in the Great Lakes there is a "Boreal White Spruce-Fir-Hardwood Forest - Inland" (BpS code 13651), and a "Boreal White Spruce-Fir-Hardwood Forest - Coastal" (BpS code 13652), which have a "1" and a "2" in the file name, and BpS code.
3. Map Zones: the string of numbers separated by an underscore represents the Map Zones that this particular document (and associated BpS state and transition model) apply to.

### Fire Frequency Table

The Fire Frequency Table can be confusing (see Fire Frequency Table screenshot below).  A few things to keep in mind when viewing this table include:

* The Severity, Avg FI (FI - Fire Interval), and Percent of All Fires values are imported from the Syncro Sim model
* The values in the Avg FI and Percent of All Fires columns are essentially a 'composite' across all succession classes, which may include classes which have very short FIs, and classes with very long FIs.
* The Min FI and Max FI columns are user populated, and may not necessarily correspond to the aforementioned columns

### Succession Classes Table

LANDFIRE did not attempt to map where succession classes were prior to European colonization, as they would have moved around.  This table is used to map where succession classes are today.  For example, in the 'Succession Class Table' screenshot below we have highlighted combinations of Existing Height and Cover (and lifeform) that would be mapped as Successsion Class A.  


### Model Parameters Table

This table is essentially an 'export' of the SyncroSim model parameters.  In other words, experts entered in all of the natural disturbances they knew about into the modeling software, and this table has all of those disturbances, numbers and the 'results' of those disturbances.

In the 'Model Parameters Table' screenshot below we have highlighted the top row that would read something like "the wind/weather/stress disturbance would impact the Early1:All succession class once every 1000 years on average (or 0.1% of the succession class yearly on average), and when that disturbance happened it would move the acre back to the beginning of the Early1: All succession class. "
