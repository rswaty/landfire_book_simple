It lays the foundation for accurate analyses, informed decision-making, and successful outcomes in various fields, from scientific research to business intelligence.\nAlthough there are many reasons to explore the attributes of your data, we want to highlight three main reasons to understand the attributes of LANDFIRE data before any analysis in GIS or R:\n\nData Familiarity: Exploring attributes provides a deep understanding of the dataset’s structure, format, and content. This familiarity is essential for making informed decisions about data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.\nUnderstanding Data Quality: Examining data attributes helps assess the quality and reliability of the dataset. Identifying missing or inaccurate information early on can prevent errors in analyses and decision-making processes.\nEffective Data Visualization: Exploring attributes aids in creating effective data visualizations. Understanding the range and distribution of variables helps you choose appropriate visualization techniques that convey the intended message and insights."

    "text": "5.3 How to explore the attributes of LANDFIRE datasets\nThere are a few ways you can view the attribute tables of any LANDFIRE dataset\n\n5.3.1 From the LANDFIRE Program website\nThe LANDFIRE program website is the most comprehensive resource for exploring and understanding the suite of LANDFIRE data. The website can be hard to navigate for some people, so we wanted to walk you through where to find the datasets we’ll be using in this exercise and how you can get more information about each of them.\n\nNavigate to the LANDFIRE Program website - www.landfire.gov\nYou will find yourself on the main page, where you’ll see several icons across the top, as well as a sidebar of links to the right.\n\nOne useful link for exploring the attributes of each dataset is the LANDFIRE Data Dictionary, which you can find midway down the left sidebar. The data dictionary is a comprehensive look at LANDFIRE data and serves as a guide to direct users to information about products, attributes, and metadata. - Within the data dictionary table of contents, you can click the layer you’re interested in and jump to the section of the document that shows the attributes and descriptions of that layer\nAnother way to explore datasets and their attributes is to navigate to the layer via the circular icons across the top of the page. Where the datasets are located within the broad categories is not always straightforward, however. Most of our datasets can be found underneath the Vegetation category, although Succession Class is under the Fire Regime Category. 1. Click the Vegetation icon 2. Below, you can click links for Existing Vegetation Cover, Existing Vegetation Type, Biophysical Settings, and others. 3. Click on the Biophysical Settings link to navigate to the Biophysical Settings description page. - This page gives you an overview of the Biophysical Settings data, as well as a link to the BpS Attribute Data Dictionary and an image of key attributes in the BpS spatial data layer\n\n\nExplore the data attributes and description pages on your own for Existing Vegetation Type, Existing Vegetation Cover, and Succession Class\n\n\nRemember that Succession Class is under the Fire Regime icon at the top of the page\n\n\n\n5.3.2 With the .csv file for each layer\nWhenever you download a LANDFIRE dataset, it will be packaged in a .zip file that includes not only the spatial data in .tif format, but also general metadata, spatial metadata, and a .csv data file. .csv stands for ‘Comma Separated Values’ and is a convenient way to display and work with the attributes of a spatial data layer in a non-spatial way (R, Excel, etc.). This allows you to examine your data and understand trends on your landscape without even opening GIS software. It also helps you understand the attributes you may want to map and explore spatially.\nExploring the .csv files of a LANDFIRE spatial layer\n\nNavigate to the folder where your spatial dataset is stored.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Your data may be stored as a .zip file. You’ll need to unzip the files and store them in a meaningful location so you can find and access them throughout this tutorial\n\n\nWithin the dataset folder or zip file, you should have a folder titled ‘CSV_Data’. Click on this folder to access the .csv file.\nDouble click on the Microsoft Excel Comma Separated Values File to open it in Microsoft Excel.\n\n\n\nNote: If you don’t use Microsoft Excel or you aren’t working in a Microsoft Windows environment, this file may not default to opening in Excel. In that case, right click, navigate to ‘open with’, and choose the spreadsheet program of your choice to view the file.\n\n\nHere you can explore the attributes and values of the datasets. We recommend using the metadata and/or data dictionary as a guide to better understand what each of the field names means and what data are being reported under that field.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Within ArcGIS Pro\nYou can also use ArcGIS Pro to view the attribute tables of each dataset in tandem with the spatial data. This may provide additional benefit, as you can select attributes of interest (a particular vegetation type, for example) and ArcGIS Pro will highlight where that attribute appears in the landscape. You can also use ArcGIS Pro’s built-in tools to generate some basic summary statistics that will allow you to explore the data on a high level.\nExploring attribute tables in ArcGIS Pro 1. Right click on the layer name in the table of contents to open the layer properties menu, then browse to ‘Attribute Table’. This option can be found near the top of the menu.\n\nThis will open the attribute table for the layer. Here you can examine and edit the attributes of the layer.\nTo explore where a particular attribute value occurs on the landscape, click on the corresponding row number in the attribute table and ArcGIS Pro will highlight those pixels in the map display.\n\n\n\nNote: Be sure to use the selection tools in the Map section at the top of the ribbon bar to unselect any rows before doing any data processing. By default, ArcGIS Pro will run all tools on only the selected data and you may end up needing to re-run tools or processes because they were only run on a subset of your full area of interest.\n\n\nTo generate basic summary statistics and charts for your data, right click on the field you’re interested in, then navigate to ‘Statistics’ in the dropdown menu.\n\nThis will open a sidebar dialogue with more options. These will change depending on the field type (text versus numeric), but will allow you to view basic summary statistics for numeric fields and format simple charts for all data types.\nArcGIS Pro will also generate a default bar chart for your data. For a text field, this will examine data types by pixel count. For a numeric field, it will show a histogram of values. You can explore the chart options in the sidebar to set the data, the data series, the axes properties, and the format of the chart. These charts can be exported or added to the final map layout.\n\nBonus Action: Generate a table of summary statistics within ArcGIS Pro\n\nRight click on your layer of interest (in the example below we use BPS_NAME) and select ‘Summarize’ from the dropdown list\nIn the Summary Statistics dialogue box, the Input Table should be set to the attribute table you’re currently exploring. You should set the Output Table to a name and location that is meaningful to you.\nExamine the Statistics Fields properties\n\nThe ‘Field’ will be the field you want to summarize. Use the dropdown arrow to select the field of interest from your table. Here, the question I’m trying to answer is “What is the total count of each BpS (regardless of map zone) in my landscape”, so I have selected COUNT, as I want to examine the total count per Bps Name.\nYou will then set the statistics type you are interested in. Since I want to know the total count of each BpS, I have selected SUM\nThe Case Field is the field or fields in the input that will be used to calculate statistics separately for each unique attribute value. In this case, we’re selecting BPS_NAME, as we want to understand the count of each BpS type on the landscape. Essentially, sum the count by BpS Name.\n\nThe tool will run and generate a table that will appear at the bottom of your table of contents. ArcGIS doesn’t give you any information about where that table is, so you’ll need to scroll to the bottom of the Table of Contents to the ‘Standalone Tables’ section in order to find it.\nRight click (don’t double click) on the table to open it and explore the summary statistics you just generated. In our case, we have each BpS Name, a frequency value for how often it occurs (my example crosses two Map Zones, so we can see whether a BpS occurs within just one of the Map Zones or both), and a Sum of the count field. This will allow us to easily see which BpS types are most and least prevalent on our landscape.\n\n\nRandy’s thoughts\n\nexplore attribute tables of each dataset\ndiscuss different attributes of EVT and BpS\nlimitations of sclass data"

    "text": "6.1 Universal Design and Accessibility\nWhen it comes to maps and visuals, it is important to pay attention to details such as font, font size, color contrast, map colors, and layout. These elements play a crucial role in ensuring the best experience for everyone. This concept is known as Universal Design.\nBy law, anything created with Federal funds is required to be accessible to all users. However, Universal Design goes beyond compliance. It emphasizes creating spaces, products, and visuals that are accessible and user-friendly for everyone, regardless of their abilities.\nImplementing Universal Design concepts in map design, cartography, and presenting complex information can be challenging. For example, map data is often complex and uses a large number of colors that can make it difficult to understand. The LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings color ramp has over 400 unique values, making it especially difficult for people with color vision differences to interpret. Additionally, many datasets have default color ramps that are not accessible or useful. This means that cartographers either have to spend time recoloring the datasets or deliver maps with inaccessible color displays, thus making their products inaccessible.\nThe LANDFIRE team is still in the early stages of implementing Universal Design. We still have a lot to learn, but we are dedicated to doing what we can to get this right. To that end, we have created a series of videos and a collection of resources to help everyone get started. You can find these resources in the description boxes of each video.\nView the Universal Design in Cartography playlist on our YouTube Channel"

For this tutorial, we will focus on adding data from a local file on our machine.\nIf you’ve been following along, you’ve already used the LANDFIRE Map Viewer to draw a rectangle around or upload your shapefile of interest then download the relevant LANDFIRE datasets. These should be saved to your computer. They may be stored as .zip files. You will need to unzip them before uploading to ArcGIS Pro.\nTo add your data to ArcGIS Pro\n\nClick on the ‘Add Data’ button (yellow rectangle with a plus sign) on the top ribbon bar. It’s located under the ‘Map’ tab in the top menu.\nBrowse to the location of your spatial data layers. If your data are in more than one folder, you’ll need to add each layer separately. If they are in the same folder, you can CTRL+click or SHIFT+click to add multiple datasets at once.\nBonus Action: You may get a message asking if you want to build pyramids. Pyramids will help your map draw faster, but I don’t recommend building pyramids on LANDFIRE data, as this can sometimes do wonky things with the display at smaller map scales. I generally click the ‘No’ box for these datasets.\n\n\n6.2.2.1 Screenshots for adding data to ArcGIS Pro\n\nWhere to click to add data.\n\n\nBrowsing to your data. Note: You will use your own file path to wherever your data are saved\n\n\nBuild Pyramids options\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Change the layer symbology\nWhen you add the LANDFIRE data to ArcGIS Pro, it often adds with either a greyscale color scheme or some other ‘Stretch’ color ramp that isn’t useful for understanding or visualizing the data. In most cases, we will want to view our data by looking at the ‘Unique Values’ of a particular field within the attribute table. For this example, we’ll be looking at the Existing Vegetation Type layer, choosing to symbolize on the EVT_Name field. The process is the same for any layer and any field, but the specific field may be different depending on what attributes you’re interested in.\nChanging the layer symbology\n\nRight click on the layer name in the table of contents to open the layer properties menu, then browse to ‘Symbology’. This option can be found about two-thirds of the way down the menu.\nThis will open the ‘Symbology’ pane in the right sidebar. Here you can use the dropdown arrow under ‘Primary Symbology’ to change the symbology type from ‘Stretch’ to ‘Unique Values’.\nThe layer will symbolize using the unique values within a field in the table. By default, raster layers will choose to symbolize on the ‘Value’ field. In this case, we’re interested in the Existing Vegetation Type names, so we’ll use the ‘Field 1’ dropdown to select the EVT_NAME field instead.\nWhen you’re done, you can choose to leave the symbology pane open, hide it using the pin icon found next to the x in the top right corner of the pane, or use the x to close it entirely. Remember that if you want to change the symbology, you’ll need to start from step 1 to open the pane again.\n\n\n6.2.3.1 Screenshots for symbolizing EVT with Unique Values\n\nWhere to click to open the symbology pane.\n\n\nSelecting Unique Values as the Primary Symbology\n\n\nEVT layer displayed with Unique values.

The .csv (or comma separated variable) format is the most useful, as it can be read by Excel as well as open source tools such as R or other free office software. Even when I am working in Excel, I export my files to .csv, since it is easier to read .csv files back in to ArcGIS Pro if I need to join new attributes to another table. Therefore, for this example, we will be exporting to .csv format.\nExporting to .csv format\n\nRight click on the layer name in the table of contents to open the layer properties menu, then browse to ‘Attribute Table’.

    "text": "6.4 BONUS ACTION: Combining two raster data layers\nIn many cases, it may be useful to combine attributes from two rasters into one data table. This is best accomplished with the ‘Combine’ tool in ArcGIS Pro. the ‘Combine’ tool is part of the Spatial Analyst tools, and it is used to overlay multiple raster datasets to create a new raster output. The tool combines the input raster datasets based on their pixel values. The resulting output raster will have a new attribute table that includes information from all the input rasters.\nThe Combine tool is particularly useful when you want to identify unique combinations of attributes present in different raster datasets. It assigns a unique value to each combination, making it easier to analyze and interpret the spatial relationships.\nIn this tutorial, we will look at how to combine LANDFIRE BpS with LANDFIRE Succession Class Data, which is one of the steps you might take to better understand your landscape.\nCombining two rasters\n\nTo get started with any tool in ArcGIS Pro, you will want to open the Geoprocessing pane. This can be found by navigating to the ‘View’ menu across the top, then selecting ‘Geoprocessing’ from the ribbon menu. The ‘Geoprocessing’ icon looks like a big red toolbox. Click it to open a new Geoprocessing pane in the right sidebar.\nFrom here, you can either navigate to the Combine tool by clicking Toolboxes -&gt; Spatial Analyst Tools -&gt; Local -&gt; Combine OR you can simply search for the tool by typing “combine” into the search box.\nIn the Combine tool, use the dropdowns or the folder icons to set the Input Rasters as all the rasters you want to combine. In this case, we will select BpS and SClass. Then set the Output Raster to something meaningful. Don’t forget to make sure the file path is to a location you will remember.\nIn addition, you will want to click on the Environments tab and set the following parameters. This is best practice for any and all raster data processing, as you want to be sure you’re saving everything with the correct coordinate systems and snapping your rasters to the same extent:\n\n\nOutput Coordinate System: Set this to be your preferred coordinate system OR use the dropdown to select one of the layers in your combine to ensure that the output layer has the same coordinate system as the input layers. In the case of LANDFIRE data, this should be NAD_1983_Contiguous_USA_Albers.\nCell size: Use the dropdown to set this to be the same as one of your input layers. This should be the same by default if your data all have 30 meter pixels, but I like to set it to be sure.\nMask: It’s not usually necessary, but I like to set this to be the extent of our shapefile or area of interest just to be sure that we’re only processing the pixels we need\nSnap Raster: This is important to pay attention to Generally, I set this to either the initial LANDFIRE dataset I’m using as my primary data (in this case, LANDFIRE BpS) or to one of the layers I’m using in the combine. It’s important that you set the snap raster to be the same raster dataset for every single raster you want to use in an analysis to ensure that the pixels will line up.\n\n\nWhen you have set the input and output values and the environment settings, click run. This may take some time depending on the size of your area of interest. If you want to check progress, you can click ‘View Details’ at the very bottom of the Geoprocessing panel where the tool is running.\nOnce you have combined the datasets, you then need to add in the fields of interest from the individual rasters, as the combine will only show you the value fields from each raster you combined. Here’s the process for that:\n\n\nUse the Join Field tool in the Geoprocessing toolbox (you can search for it). This tool permanently joins the contents of one table to another based on a common attribute field (in this case, the value field of the raster). You can select which fields from the join table will be added to the input table.\nTo join in the BpS Attributes, set the input table to your combine table (in this example it’s called BpS_SClass_ADK), then set the Input Join Field to the BpS Value field (in this example, BpS_ADK – the name of my BpS layer). Set the join table as your BpS layer (here, BpS_ADK), and the Join Table Field to ‘Value’. This will match the value field from your BpS layer to the correct values in the correct field in your combine.\n\n\n\nBefore you hit run, it’s important to select which fields you want to join. You can do this either by Field Mapping or by Selecting Transfer Fields. This is set in the Transfer Method dropdown. In this example, I have chosen to use field mapping. With field mapping, you see a list of all the fields in the Join table (BpS) and have the option to click an x next to any field you don’t want to join. In our case, we want to join all the fields except the value field (which we already have).\n\n\nTo join in the SClass attributes, you follow the same procedure as above, but set the input Join field to the SClass value field (SClass_ADK) and the Join table to your SClass layer (SClass_ADK). I also took out most of the fields in the field mapping, because I am only interested in the label and description fields.\nWhen you are done, your combined layer should have an attribute table that includes all the attributes from your BpS layer as well as the label and description fields from your SClass layer. This will allow you to understand what proportion of each BpS is in a given succession class, as mapped by LANDFIRE.\n\n\n6.4.0.1 Screenshots for combining two rasters\n\nWhere to click to open the Geoprocessing tools.\n\n\nOpen the Combine tool\n\n\nSet the parameters\n\n\nSet the environments\n\n\nJoin Field Settings\n{fig-alt=“\"A screenshot showing the parameters for both join field runs as described in the text above.

One way to do that is with charts.\nBelow we will take two approaches: 1) making charts with Datawrapper.de as it may be new to people, is free and makes nice charts and 2) with R as it too is free, is easy to replicate and can make nice charts."
