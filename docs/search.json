To get a Map Zone map you can click the “View map of LANDFIRE Map Zones” text (highlighted with blue arrow on ‘Ways to download’ screenshot below), or click https://landfirereview.org/IMG/USmapzones-v1_July2015.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking boxes will select the ‘Vegetation Types’ and/or ‘Map Zones’ and/or specific BpSs for filtering or downloading purposes.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can search for a BpS of interest by typing in the ‘Search…’ box(#3 on ‘Ways to select’ screenshot below). A few things to keep in mind when searching:\n\nGenus and/or species, common or Latin (e.g., ‘Fraxinus’, or ‘White Ash’ )\nMost text terms will work, numbers will not. For example, ‘hurricane’ will work return BpSs, ‘1362’ (an actual BpS number) will not.\nYou can first filter by ‘Vegetation Types’ and/or ‘Map Zones’, then search to narrow results.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Download documents of interest\nOnce you have selected the BpSs you want to get descriptions for you can take one more step to get your documents:\n\nIf you want all of the BpSs for selected ‘Vegetation Types’ and/or ‘Map Zones’ you will click the ‘Download All Search Results Documents’ button (indicated with arrow on ‘Download all’ screenshot below).\nIf you have checked specific BpSs for download, you will click the ‘Download All Selected Documents’ button (inidcated with an arrow on ‘Download selected’ screenshot below).\n\nClicking either of the ‘Download’ buttons will initiate download of a .zip file that will most likely land in your ‘Downloads’ folder.

    "text": "6.1 Universal Design and Accessibility\nWhen it comes to maps and visuals, it is important to pay attention to details such as font, font size, color contrast, map colors, and layout. These elements play a crucial role in ensuring the best experience for everyone. This concept is known as Universal Design.\nBy law, anything created with Federal funds is required to be accessible to all users. However, Universal Design goes beyond compliance. It emphasizes creating spaces, products, and visuals that are accessible and user-friendly for everyone, regardless of their abilities.\nImplementing Universal Design concepts in map design, cartography, and presenting complex information can be challenging. For example, map data is often complex and uses a large number of colors that can make it difficult to understand. The LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings color ramp has over 400 unique values, making it especially difficult for people with color vision differences to interpret. Additionally, many datasets have default color ramps that are not accessible or useful. This means that cartographers either have to spend time recoloring the datasets or deliver maps with inaccessible color displays, thus making their products inaccessible.\nThe LANDFIRE team is still in the early stages of implementing Universal Design. We still have a lot to learn, but we are dedicated to doing what we can to get this right. To that end, we have created a series of videos and a collection of resources to help everyone get started. You can find these resources in the description boxes of each video.\nView the Universal Design in Cartography playlist on our YouTube Channel"

    "text": "6.2 Making a Map in ArcGIS Pro\n\n6.2.1 What you will learn here\n\nHow to bring data into ArcGIS Pro\nHow to change the layer symbology\nHow to combine two raster datasets\nHow to export an attribute table\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Adding data in ArcGIS Pro\nThere are several ways you can add data in ArcGIS Pro: from a local file, from a url (using a WMS or REST service, for example), from ArcGIS Online, from ESRI’s living atlas, and more. For this tutorial, we will focus on adding data from a local file on our machine.\nIf you’ve been following along, you’ve already used the LANDFIRE Map Viewer to draw a rectangle around or upload your shapefile of interest then download the relevant LANDFIRE datasets. These should be saved to your computer. They may be stored as .zip files. You will need to unzip them before uploading to ArcGIS Pro.\nTo add your data to ArcGIS Pro\n\nClick on the ‘Add Data’ button (yellow rectangle with a plus sign) on the top ribbon bar. It’s located under the ‘Map’ tab in the top menu.\nBrowse to the location of your spatial data layers. If your data are in more than one folder, you’ll need to add each layer separately. If they are in the same folder, you can CTRL+click or SHIFT+click to add multiple datasets at once.\nYou may get a message asking if you want to build pyramids. Pyramids will help your map draw faster, but I don’t recommend building pyramids on LANDFIRE data, as this can sometimes do wonky things with the display at smaller map scales. I generally click the ‘No’ box for these datasets.\n\n\n6.2.2.1 Screenshots for adding data to ArcGIS Pro\n\nWhere to click to add data.\n\n\nBrowsing to your data. Note: You will use your own file path to wherever your data are saved\n\n\nBuild Pyramids options\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Change the layer symbology\nWhen you add the LANDFIRE data to ArcGIS Pro, it often adds with either a greyscale color scheme or some other ‘Stretch’ color ramp that isn’t useful for understanding or visualizing the data. In most cases, we will want to view our data by looking at the ‘Unique Values’ of a particular field within the attribute table. For this example, we’ll be looking at the Existing Vegetation Type layer, choosing to symbolize on the EVT_Name field. The process is the same for any layer and any field, but the specific field may be different depending on what attributes you’re interested in.\nChanging the layer symbology\n\nRight click on the layer name in the table of contents to open the layer properties menu, then browse to ‘Symbology’. This option can be found about two-thirds of the way down the menu.\nThis will open the ‘Symbology’ pane in the right sidebar. Here you can use the dropdown arrow under ‘Primary Symbology’ to change the symbology type from ‘Stretch’ to ‘Unique Values’.\nThe layer will symbolize using the unique values within a field in the table. By default, raster layers will choose to symbolize on the ‘Value’ field. In this case, we’re interested in the Existing Vegetation Type names, so we’ll use the ‘Field 1’ dropdown to select the EVT_NAME field instead.\nWhen you’re done, you can choose to leave the symbology pane open, hide it using the pin icon found next to the x in the top right corner of the pane, or use the x to close it entirely. Remember that if you want to change the symbology, you’ll need to start from step 1 to open the pane again.\n\n\n6.2.3.1 Screenshots for symbolizing EVT with Unique Values\n\nWhere to click to open the symbology pane.\n\n\nSelecting Unique Values as the Primary Symbology\n\n\nEVT layer displayed with Unique values. Note: This is using the LANDFIRE default color ramp and does not follow Universal Design best practices. Users with non-standard color vision may not be able to see the data patterns in this map\n\n\nBONUS ACTION: Closing or pinning the Symbology pane"
