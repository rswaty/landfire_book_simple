To get a Map Zone map you can click the “View map of LANDFIRE Map Zones” text (highlighted with blue arrow on ‘Ways to download’ screenshot below), or click https://landfirereview.org/IMG/USmapzones-v1_July2015.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking boxes will select the ‘Vegetation Types’ and/or ‘Map Zones’ and/or specific BpSs for filtering or downloading purposes.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can search for a BpS of interest by typing in the ‘Search…’ box(#3 on ‘Ways to select’ screenshot below). A few things to keep in mind when searching:\n\nGenus and/or species, common or Latin (e.g., ‘Fraxinus’, or ‘White Ash’ )\nMost text terms will work, numbers will not. For example, ‘hurricane’ will work return BpSs, ‘1362’ (an actual BpS number) will not.\nYou can first filter by ‘Vegetation Types’ and/or ‘Map Zones’, then search to narrow results.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Download documents of interest\nOnce you have selected the BpSs you want to get descriptions for you can take one more step to get your documents:\n\nIf you want all of the BpSs for selected ‘Vegetation Types’ and/or ‘Map Zones’ you will click the ‘Download All Search Results Documents’ button (indicated with arrow on ‘Download all’ screenshot below).\nIf you have checked specific BpSs for download, you will click the ‘Download All Selected Documents’ button (inidcated with an arrow on ‘Download selected’ screenshot below).\n\nClicking either of the ‘Download’ buttons will initiate download of a .zip file that will most likely land in your ‘Downloads’ folder. See ‘Windows extraction tool being used to unzip all BpS descriptions file’ screenshot above for an example of how to unzip.\n\n\n\nBeware when clicking the ‘Download All Search Results Documents’ button. If not careful you will end up with a huge download of many more documents than you want! Make sure to filter by ‘Vegetation Types’ and/or ‘Map Zones’ first.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2.1 Screenshots of selecting and downloading BpSs\n\nWays to select your BpS(s) of interest.\n\n\n\nDownloading all BpSs from filtering by ‘Vegetation Types’ and/or ‘Map Zones’\n\n\nDownloading selected BpSs"
