    "text": "1.4 What’s in a BpS document\nOnce you download and unzip your selected BpS documents, what do you actually have? One or more Word documents that in very general terms describe how the ecosystems of the US ‘looked and functioned’ prior to European colonization. We hope the documents are largely self-explanatory. That said, below we’ll highlight a few important considerations when reading these documents.\n\n1.4.1 File name, Map Zones and that number at the top\nThe BpS documents were saved with a numeric code such as “13700_60_63_64_65_66.docx”. This number represents three things:\n\nBpS code: this is the first 4 digits, e.g., “1370” in our example for the “Appalachian (Hemlock-)Northern Hardwood Forest”.\nBpS splits: this is the fifth digit, or “0” in our example. Occasionally an original BpS would be ‘split’ into multiple. For example, in the Great Lakes there is a “Boreal White Spruce-Fir-Hardwood Forest - Inland” (BpS code 13651), and a “Boreal White Spruce-Fir-Hardwood Forest - Coastal” (BpS code 13652), which have a “1” and a “2” in the file name, and BpS code.\nMap Zones: the string of numbers separated by an underscore represents the Map Zones that this particular document (and associated BpS state and transition model) apply to.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Fire Frequency Table\nThe Fire Frequency Table can be confusing (see Fire Frequency Table screenshot below). A few things to keep in mind when viewing this table include:\n\nThe Severity, Avg FI (FI - Fire Interval), and Percent of All Fires values are imported from the Syncro Sim model\nThe values in the Avg FI and Percent of All Fires columns are essentially a ‘composite’ across all succession classes, which may include classes which have very short FIs, and classes with very long FIs.\nThe Min FI and Max FI columns are user populated, and may not necessarily correspond to the aforementioned columns\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Succession Classes Table\nLANDFIRE did not attempt to map where succession classes were prior to European colonization, as they would have moved around. This table is used to map where succession classes are today. For example, in the ‘Succession Class Table’ screenshot below we have highlighted combinations of Existing Height and Cover (and lifeform) that would be mapped as Successsion Class A.\n\n\n1.4.4 Model Parameters Table\nThis table is essentially an ‘export’ of the SyncroSim model parameters. In other words, experts entered in all of the natural disturbances they knew about into the modeling software, and this table has all of those disturbances, numbers and the ‘results’ of those disturbances.\nIn the ‘Model Parameters Table’ screenshot below we have highlighted the top row that would read something like “the wind/weather/stress disturbance would impact the Early1:All succession class once every 1000 years on average (or 0.1% of the succession class yearly on average), and when that disturbance happened it would move the acre back to the beginning of the Early1: All succession class.”\n\n1.4.4.1 Screenshots of What’s in a BpS document\n\nFire Frequency Table.\n\n\nSuccession Classes Table"

It lays the foundation for accurate analyses, informed decision-making, and successful outcomes in various fields, from scientific research to business intelligence.\nAlthough there are many reasons to explore the attributes of your data, we want to highlight three main reasons to understand the attributes of LANDFIRE data before any analysis in GIS or R:\n\nData Familiarity: Exploring attributes provides a deep understanding of the dataset’s structure, format, and content. This familiarity is essential for making informed decisions about data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.\nUnderstanding Data Quality: Examining data attributes helps assess the quality and reliability of the dataset. Identifying missing or inaccurate information early on can prevent errors in analyses and decision-making processes.\nEffective Data Visualization: Exploring attributes aids in creating effective data visualizations. Understanding the range and distribution of variables helps you choose appropriate visualization techniques that convey the intended message and insights."

    "text": "5.3 How to explore the attributes of LANDFIRE datasets\nThere are a few ways you can view the attribute tables of any LANDFIRE dataset\n\n5.3.1 From the LANDFIRE Program website\nThe LANDFIRE program website is the most comprehensive resource for exploring and understanding the suite of LANDFIRE data. The website can be hard to navigate for some people, so we wanted to walk you through where to find the datasets we’ll be using in this exercise and how you can get more information about each of them.\n\nNavigate to the LANDFIRE Program website - www.landfire.gov\nYou will find yourself on the main page, where you’ll see several icons across the top, as well as a sidebar of links to the right.\n\nOne useful link for exploring the attributes of each dataset is the LANDFIRE Data Dictionary, which you can find midway down the left sidebar. The data dictionary is a comprehensive look at LANDFIRE data and serves as a guide to direct users to information about products, attributes, and metadata. - Within the data dictionary table of contents, you can click the layer you’re interested in and jump to the section of the document that shows the attributes and descriptions of that layer\nAnother way to explore datasets and their attributes is to navigate to the layer via the circular icons across the top of the page. Where the datasets are located within the broad categories is not always straightforward, however. Most of our datasets can be found underneath the Vegetation category, although Succession Class is under the Fire Regime Category. 1. Click the Vegetation icon 2. Below, you can click links for Existing Vegetation Cover, Existing Vegetation Type, Biophysical Settings, and others. 3. Click on the Biophysical Settings link to navigate to the Biophysical Settings description page. - This page gives you an overview of the Biophysical Settings data, as well as a link to the BpS Attribute Data Dictionary and an image of key attributes in the BpS spatial data layer\n\nExplore the data attributes and description pages on your own for Existing Vegetation Type, Existing Vegetation Cover, and Succession Class.\n\n\n\nRemember that Succession Class is under the Fire Regime icon at the top of the page\n\n\n5.3.1.1 Screenshot for where to find attributes on the LANDFIRE website\n\nTwo options for where to find the data dictionary and key attributes\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 With the .csv file for each layer\nWhenever you download a LANDFIRE dataset, it will be packaged in a .zip file that includes not only the spatial data in .tif format, but also general metadata, spatial metadata, and a .csv data file. .csv stands for ‘Comma Separated Values’ and is a convenient way to display and work with the attributes of a spatial data layer in a non-spatial way (R, Excel, etc.). This allows you to examine your data and understand trends on your landscape without even opening GIS software. It also helps you understand the attributes you may want to map and explore spatially.\nExploring the .csv files of a LANDFIRE spatial layer\n\nNavigate to the folder where your spatial dataset is stored.\n\n\n\nYour data may be stored as a .zip file. You’ll need to unzip the files and store them in a meaningful location so you can find and access them throughout this tutorial\n\n\nWithin the dataset folder or zip file, you should have a folder titled ‘CSV_Data’. Click on this folder to access the .csv file.\nDouble click on the Microsoft Excel Comma Separated Values File to open it in Microsoft Excel.\n\n\n\nIf you don’t use Microsoft Excel or you aren’t working in a Microsoft Windows environment, this file may not default to opening in Excel. In that case, right click, navigate to ‘open with’, and choose the spreadsheet program of your choice to view the file.\n\n\nHere you can explore the attributes and values of the datasets. We recommend using the metadata and/or data dictionary as a guide to better understand what each of the field names means and what data are being reported under that field.\n\n\n5.3.2.1 Screenshots for where to find the .csv file\n\nLocation of the CSV_Data folder inside the EVT download folder\n\n\nLocation of the .csv file within the CSV_Data folder\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Within ArcGIS Pro\nYou can also use ArcGIS Pro to view the attribute tables of each dataset in tandem with the spatial data. This may provide additional benefit, as you can select attributes of interest (a particular vegetation type, for example) and ArcGIS Pro will highlight where that attribute appears in the landscape. You can also use ArcGIS Pro’s built-in tools to generate some basic summary statistics that will allow you to explore the data on a high level.\nExploring attribute tables in ArcGIS Pro\n\nRight click on the layer name in the table of contents to open the layer properties menu, then browse to ‘Attribute Table’. This option can be found near the top of the menu.\nThis will open the attribute table for the layer. Here you can examine and edit the attributes of the layer.\nTo explore where a particular attribute value occurs on the landscape, click on the corresponding row number in the attribute table and ArcGIS Pro will highlight those pixels in the map display.\n\n\n\nBe sure to use the selection tools in the Map section at the top of the ribbon bar to unselect any rows before doing any data processing. By default, ArcGIS Pro will run all tools on only the selected data and you may end up needing to re-run tools or processes because they were only run on a subset of your full area of interest.\n\n\nTo generate basic summary statistics and charts for your data, right click on the field you’re interested in, then navigate to ‘Statistics’ in the dropdown menu.\n\nThis will open a sidebar dialogue with more options. These will change depending on the field type (text versus numeric), but will allow you to view basic summary statistics for numeric fields and format simple charts for all data types.\nArcGIS Pro will also generate a default bar chart for your data. For a text field, this will examine data types by pixel count. For a numeric field, it will show a histogram of values. You can explore the chart options in the sidebar to set the data, the data series, the axes properties, and the format of the chart. These charts can be exported or added to the final map layout.\n\nBonus Action: Generate a table of summary statistics within ArcGIS Pro\n\nRight click on your layer of interest (in the example below we use BPS_NAME) and select ‘Summarize’ from the dropdown list.\nIn the Summary Statistics dialogue box, the Input Table should be set to the attribute table you’re currently exploring. You should set the Output Table to a name and location that is meaningful to you.\nExamine the Statistics Fields properties\n\nThe ‘Field’ will be the field you want to summarize. Use the dropdown arrow to select the field of interest from your table. Here, the question I’m trying to answer is “What is the total count of each BpS (regardless of map zone) in my landscape”, so I have selected COUNT, as I want to examine the total count per Bps Name.\nYou will then set the statistics type you are interested in. Since I want to know the total count of each BpS, I have selected SUM.\nThe Case Field is the field or fields in the input that will be used to calculate statistics separately for each unique attribute value. In this case, we’re selecting BPS_NAME, as we want to understand the count of each BpS type on the landscape. Essentially, sum the count by BpS Name.\n\nThe tool will run and generate a table that will appear at the bottom of your table of contents. ArcGIS doesn’t give you any information about where that table is, so you’ll need to scroll to the bottom of the Table of Contents to the ‘Standalone Tables’ section in order to find it.\nRight click (don’t double click) on the table to open it and explore the summary statistics you just generated. In our case, we have each BpS Name, a frequency value for how often it occurs (my example crosses two Map Zones, so we can see whether a BpS occurs within just one of the Map Zones or both), and a Sum of the count field. This will allow us to easily see which BpS types are most and least prevalent on our landscape.\n\n\n\n5.3.3.1 Screenshots for finding and working with the attribute tables in ArcGIS Pro\n\nHow to open the attribute table of a layer\n\n\nHighlighting a BpS in the attribute table and the map\n\n\nUnselecting attributes\n\n\nGenerating summary statistics\n\n\nSummary Statistics Chart with some basic options selected\nSet the aggregation to Sum and select count as the numeric field to replicate this chart.

    "text": "5.4 Key attributes of four LANDFIRE datasets\nAs we mentioned above, you can easily view the key attributes of various LANDFIRE datasets and what those attributes mean on the LANDFIRE Program website by looking at the item page for each layer of interest. For this exercise, we are interested in four datasets: Biophysical Settings, Existing Vegetation Type, Existing Vegetation Cover, and Succession Class.\n\n5.4.1 Biophysical Settings\nLANDFIRE’s Biophysical Settings data, also known as BpS, represents the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to European colonization and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of the historical disturbance regime. LANDFIRE uses BpS to depict reference conditions of vegetation across landscapes.\nAs of 2016, BpS now includes information on the historical fire regime, such as fire return intervals, percent of fire severities, and fire regime groups. Since LANDFIRE’s fire regime information is based on the historic context, we include it with BpS to provide a better picture of the pre-colonization landscape to the best of our knowledge.\n\n\nThe Biophysical Settings attributes correspond with the information in the Biophysical Settings Descriptions discussed in the BpS Description section of this website. We suggest that you review this information for a more complete understanding of the Biophysical Settings attributes.\n\nKey BpS Attributes include:\n\nBPS_CODE: The unique code LANDFIRE uses for each Biophysical Setting\nZone: The NLCD map zone(s) the Bps is located in or relates to\nBPS_MODEL: The unique BpS Model code. Ths combines the BpS code with the zone(s) the model is located in. In some cases, a BpS with the same name and BpS Code may be split among map zones because the vegetation or disturbance regimes vary enough that the descriptions differ. An example of this is the ‘Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods forest’ BpS (13020), which has four different BpS Models, although it is mapped as one BpS type. (See the screenshot below.)\nBPS_NAME: The name of the Biophysical Setting. The name is matched to the BpS Code, not the BpS model number.\nGROUPVEG: Coarse vegetation type groupings highlighting the high-level dominant vegetation within that BpS. Note that if a BpS is listed as ‘Hardwood’ it may actually be a mix of hardwood, herbaceous, savannah, and more, but LANDFIRE’s mapping identified hardwoods as dominating most of the landscape.\nFire Regime Attributes\n\nFRI_REPLAC: Average historic replacement-severity fire frequency for the BpS\nFRI_MIXED: Average historic mixed-severity fire frequency for the BpS\nFRI_SURFAC: Average historic surface-severity fire frequency for the BpS\nFRI_ALLFIR: Average historic fire frequency for all fires within the BpS\nPRC_REPLAC: Percent of historic fires with replacement severity for the BpS\nPRC_MIXED: Percent of historic fires with mixed serverity for the BpS\nPRC_SURFAC: Percent of historic fires with surface severity for the BpS\nFRG_NEW: The fire regime group this BpS is found in. Fire regime groups are based on a combination of fire return interval and fire severity. The current Fire Regime Groups were updated in 2016, and have been modified from a previous classification. You can find the new breakdown of fire regime groups in the Attribute Data Dictionary for the BpS spatial data.\n\nFire Regime Groups are assigned as follows:\n\nI-A (1A): Percent replacement fire less than 66.7%, fire return interval 0-5 years\nI-B (1B): Percent replacement fire less than 66.7%, fire return interval 6-15 years\nI-C (1C): Percent replacement fire less than 66.7%, fire return interval 16-35 years\nII-A (2A): Percent replacement fire greater than 66.7%, fire return interval 0-5 years\nII-B (2B): Percent replacement fire greater than 66.7%, fire return interval 6-15 years\nII-C (2C): Percent replacement fire greater than 66.7%, fire return interval 16-35 years\nIII-A (3A): Percent replacement fire less than 80%, fire return interval 36-100 years\nIII-B (3B): Percent replacement fire less than 66.7%, fire return interval 101-200 years\nIV-A (4A): Percent replacement fire greater than 80%, fire return interval 36-100 years\nIV-B (4B): Percent replacement fire greater than 66.7%, fire return interval 101-200 years\nV-A (5A): Any severity, fire return interval 201-500 years\nV-B (5B): Any severity, fire return interval 501 or more years\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1.1 Screenshots of BpS key attributes and the LANDFIRE Fire Regime Groups\n\nKey Attributes of BpS Data\n\n\nFire Regime Group Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Existing Vegetation Type\nLANDFIRE’s Existing Vegetation Type data, also known as EVT, shows the current distribution (through 2016) of the terrestrial ecological systems classification, developed by NatureServe for the western hemisphere. A terrestrial ecological system is a group of plant community types that are often found together in similar landscapes with similar environmental conditions.\nEVT also includes ruderal or semi-natural vegetation types within the U.S. National Vegetation Classification. The LANDFIRE Ruderal NVC Groups Descriptions for CONUS provides info for each ruderal NVC Group, including species, distribution, and classification details.\nKey BpS Attributes include:\n\nEVT_Name: Ecological Systems names\nEVT_Fuel: The Ecological Systems code used for LANDFIRE fuels product development\nEVT_Fuel_N: The Ecological Systems class name used for fuel product development\nEVT_LF: Major vegetation lifeform (e.g., tree, shrub, herb, sparse) for the ecological system. Note that if an EVT Lifeform is listed as ‘tree’ it may actually be a mix of tree, herb, savanna, and more, but the ecological system and LANDFIRE identified trees as dominating most of the landscape.\nEVT_GP_N: The vegetation type name (e.g. grassland and steppe, longleaf pine, yellow birch-sugar maple forest). This is more specific than the lifeform, but less specific than the ecological system (EVT Name).\nEVT_PHYS: Vegetation physiognomy of the ecological system (e.g. Grassland, Riparian, Herbaceous, Sparsely Vegetated)\nSAF_SRM: Society of American Foresters/Society for Range Management cover types\nEVT_ORDER: FGDC Vegetation physiognomic order (highest level/most general classification, e.g. Tree Dominated)\nEVT_CLASS: FGDC Vegetation class (mid level/more specific, e.g. Closed tree canopy)\nEVT_SBCLS: FGDC Vegetation subclass (lowest level/most specific, e.g. Deciduous closed tree canopy)\n\n\n5.4.2.1 Screenshot of EVT key attributes\n\nKey Attributes of EVT Data\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Existing Vegetation Cover\nLANDFIRE’s Existing Vegetation Cover dataset, also known as EVC, works in tandem with the Existing Vegetation Class dataset to give a more detailed picture of the current vegetation on a landscape. EVC represents the percent cover of the live canopy layer for a 30-m cell.\nEVC is generated separately for tree, shrub, and herbaceous cover lifeforms using training data and other geospatial layers. Percentage tree, shrub, and herbaceous canopy cover training data are generated using plot-level ground-based visual assessments and lidar observations.\nKey EVC Attributes include:\n\nCLASSNAMES: The main attribute of EVC. This combines the EVT lifeform with the percent canopy cover of each lifeform. Key lifeforms are described below. As with all LANDFIRE layers, you can get more detailed information about the individual attributes from the EVC Attribute Data Dictionary.\n\nTree Cover: percent tree cover\nShrub Cover: percent shrub cover\nHerb Cover: percent herbaceous/grassland cover\nDeveloped-Upland Forest Shrub: Five classes of developed upland vegetation\nDeveloped: Three classes of developed landscapes\nDeveloped-Roads: Pixels identified as roads\nNASS Crops: Six classes of National Agricultural Statistics Service defined cropland\n\n\n\n5.4.3.1 Screenshot of EVC key attributes\n\nKey Attributes of EVT Data\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.4 Succession Classes\nThe LANDFIRE Succession Class (SClass) product describes the current condition of vegetation in terms of species composition (leaf-form and life-form), percent cover, and the range of heights of each successional state in a Biophysical Setting. SClass can also show uncharacteristic vegetation such as non-native plants, tree plantations, and canopy cover. These additional components are not part of the usual variation in the types and structures of plants in a BpS. The Succession classes don’t directly measure the fuel characteristics of the current vegetation, but they represent specific stages in plant development or how often fires and other disturbances occur.\nTo produce SClass, mapping rules defined by local and regional experts during the original development and subsequent review of each BpS are applied to the relevant current vegetation layers. SClass mapping rules for all natural BpS are available for download in spreadsheet format.\n\n\nIt is important to understand that the Succession Class dataset alone isn’t incredibly useful. It needs to be combined with the Biophysical Settings Models and Descriptions (see part 1 of this workbook) and the Biophysical Settings spatial data and/or Existing Vegetaion data (see part 5 of this workbook) in order to be meaningful. Without a deeper understanding of the underlying Biophysical Setting and its related successional states and a bigger picture of the current vegetation type, cover, and height, all succession class gives us is a letter without a lot of meaning. All these LANDFIRE datasets are mapped consistently and are meant to be used together to generate the best picture of your landscape condition in the past and present, helping you make a plan for where you want to go in the future.\n\nKey Succession Class attributes include\n\nDescription: LANDFIRE’s Succession Classes categorized into up to five succession classes, with each succession class defined in the corresponding Biophysical Settings model. There are two additional classes – UN for uncharacteristic native vegetation type, cover, or height; and UE for uncharacteristic species (invasive or exotic vegetation types)."

    "text": "6.1 Universal Design and Accessibility\nWhen it comes to maps and visuals, it is important to pay attention to details such as font, font size, color contrast, map colors, and layout. These elements play a crucial role in ensuring the best experience for everyone. This concept is known as Universal Design.\nBy law, anything created with Federal funds is required to be accessible to all users. However, Universal Design goes beyond compliance. It emphasizes creating spaces, products, and visuals that are accessible and user-friendly for everyone, regardless of their abilities.\nImplementing Universal Design concepts in map design, cartography, and presenting complex information can be challenging. For example, map data is often complex and uses a large number of colors that can make it difficult to understand. The LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings color ramp has over 400 unique values, making it especially difficult for people with color vision differences to interpret. Additionally, many datasets have default color ramps that are not accessible or useful. This means that cartographers either have to spend time recoloring the datasets or deliver maps with inaccessible color displays, thus making their products inaccessible.\nThe LANDFIRE team is still in the early stages of implementing Universal Design. We still have a lot to learn, but we are dedicated to doing what we can to get this right. To that end, we have created a series of videos and a collection of resources to help everyone get started. You can find these resources in the description boxes of each video.\nView the Universal Design in Cartography playlist on our YouTube Channel"

For this tutorial, we will focus on adding data from a local file on our machine.\nIf you’ve been following along, you’ve already used the LANDFIRE Map Viewer to draw a rectangle around or upload your shapefile of interest then download the relevant LANDFIRE datasets. These should be saved to your computer. They may be stored as .zip files. You will need to unzip them before uploading to ArcGIS Pro.\nTo add your data to ArcGIS Pro\n\nClick on the ‘Add Data’ button (yellow rectangle with a plus sign) on the top ribbon bar. It’s located under the ‘Map’ tab in the top menu.\nBrowse to the location of your spatial data layers. If your data are in more than one folder, you’ll need to add each layer separately. If they are in the same folder, you can CTRL+click or SHIFT+click to add multiple datasets at once.\nBonus Action: You may get a message asking if you want to build pyramids. Pyramids will help your map draw faster, but I don’t recommend building pyramids on LANDFIRE data, as this can sometimes do wonky things with the display at smaller map scales. I generally click the ‘No’ box for these datasets.\n\n\n6.2.2.1 Screenshots for adding data to ArcGIS Pro\n\nWhere to click to add data.\n\n\nBrowsing to your data. Note: You will use your own file path to wherever your data are saved\n\n\nBuild Pyramids options\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Change the layer symbology\nWhen you add the LANDFIRE data to ArcGIS Pro, it often adds with either a greyscale color scheme or some other ‘Stretch’ color ramp that isn’t useful for understanding or visualizing the data. In most cases, we will want to view our data by looking at the ‘Unique Values’ of a particular field within the attribute table. For this example, we’ll be looking at the Existing Vegetation Type layer, choosing to symbolize on the EVT_Name field. The process is the same for any layer and any field, but the specific field may be different depending on what attributes you’re interested in.\nChanging the layer symbology\n\nRight click on the layer name in the table of contents to open the layer properties menu, then browse to ‘Symbology’. This option can be found about two-thirds of the way down the menu.\nThis will open the ‘Symbology’ pane in the right sidebar. Here you can use the dropdown arrow under ‘Primary Symbology’ to change the symbology type from ‘Stretch’ to ‘Unique Values’.\nThe layer will symbolize using the unique values within a field in the table. By default, raster layers will choose to symbolize on the ‘Value’ field. In this case, we’re interested in the Existing Vegetation Type names, so we’ll use the ‘Field 1’ dropdown to select the EVT_NAME field instead.\nBonus Action: When you’re done, you can choose to leave the symbology pane open, hide it using the pin icon found next to the x in the top right corner of the pane, or use the x to close it entirely. Remember that if you want to change the symbology, you’ll need to start from step 1 to open the pane again.\n\n\n6.2.3.1 Screenshots for symbolizing EVT with Unique Values\n\nWhere to click to open the symbology pane.\n\n\nSelecting Unique Values as the Primary Symbology\n\n\nEVT layer displayed with Unique values.

The .csv (or comma separated variable) format is the most useful, as it can be read by Excel as well as open source tools such as R or other free office software. Even when I am working in Excel, I export my files to .csv, since it is easier to read .csv files back in to ArcGIS Pro if I need to join new attributes to another table. Therefore, for this example, we will be exporting to .csv format.\nExporting to .csv format\n\nRight click on the layer name in the table of contents to open the layer properties menu, then browse to ‘Attribute Table’. This option can be found near the top of the menu.\n\nThis will open the attribute table for the layer. Here you can examine and edit the attributes of the layer. For more information on attribute tables in LANDFIRE, please see the https://rswaty.github.io/landfire_book_simple/gis-explore.html section of this tutorial.\n\nTo export the attribute table, click the ‘hamburger menu’ (three horizontal lines in the top right corner of the attribute table pane) then select Export at the bottom of the menu.\nThis will open a pop up box, asking you for more information. At a minimum, you will want to make sure you have done the following:\n\nInput Table: Select the attribute table you want to export using either the dropdown or the file folder.\nOutput Table: Browse to the folder where you want to save the table. Name the table something meaningful, then add the .csv file extension at the end.\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t add the file extension, ArcGIS Pro will save the table as either a geodatabase table or a .dbf, both of which are much more difficult to work with outside the ArcGIS environment.\n\n\nWhen you have selected the correct table and saved the output to a .csv file in a meaningful location, click OK in the Export Table dialogue box.\n\n\n6.2.4.1 Screenshots for exporting an attribute table as a .csv\n\nWhere to click to open the attribute table.\n\n\nExporting the Attribute Table\n\n\nExport table options\n\n–"

    "section": "6.3 BONUS ACTION: Combining two raster data layers",
    "text": "6.3 BONUS ACTION: Combining two raster data layers\nIn many cases, it may be useful to combine attributes from two rasters into one data table. This is best accomplished with the ‘Combine’ tool in ArcGIS Pro. the ‘Combine’ tool is part of the Spatial Analyst tools, and it is used to overlay multiple raster datasets to create a new raster output. The tool combines the input raster datasets based on their pixel values. The resulting output raster will have a new attribute table that includes information from all the input rasters.\nThe Combine tool is particularly useful when you want to identify unique combinations of attributes present in different raster datasets. It assigns a unique value to each combination, making it easier to analyze and interpret the spatial relationships.\nIn this tutorial, we will look at how to combine LANDFIRE BpS with LANDFIRE Succession Class Data, which is one of the steps you might take to better understand your landscape.\nCombining two rasters\n\nTo get started with any tool in ArcGIS Pro, you will want to open the Geoprocessing pane. This can be found by navigating to the ‘View’ menu across the top, then selecting ‘Geoprocessing’ from the ribbon menu. The ‘Geoprocessing’ icon looks like a big red toolbox. Click it to open a new Geoprocessing pane in the right sidebar.\nFrom here, you can either navigate to the Combine tool by clicking Toolboxes -&gt; Spatial Analyst Tools -&gt; Local -&gt; Combine OR you can simply search for the tool by typing “combine” into the search box.\nIn the Combine tool, use the dropdowns or the folder icons to set the Input Rasters as all the rasters you want to combine. In this case, we will select BpS and SClass. Then set the Output Raster to something meaningful. Don’t forget to make sure the file path is to a location you will remember.\nIn addition, you will want to click on the Environments tab and set the following parameters. This is best practice for any and all raster data processing, as you want to be sure you’re saving everything with the correct coordinate systems and snapping your rasters to the same extent:\n\nOutput Coordinate System: Set this to be your preferred coordinate system OR use the dropdown to select one of the layers in your combine to ensure that the output layer has the same coordinate system as the input layers. In the case of LANDFIRE data, this should be NAD_1983_Contiguous_USA_Albers.\nCell size: Use the dropdown to set this to be the same as one of your input layers. This should be the same by default if your data all have 30 meter pixels, but I like to set it to be sure.\nMask: It’s not usually necessary, but I like to set this to be the extent of our shapefile or area of interest just to be sure that we’re only processing the pixels we need\nSnap Raster: This is important to pay attention to. Generally, I set this to either the initial LANDFIRE dataset I’m using as my primary data (in this case, LANDFIRE BpS) or to one of the layers I’m using in the combine. It’s important that you set the snap raster to be the same raster dataset for every single raster you want to use in an analysis to ensure that the pixels will line up.\n\nWhen you have set the input and output values and the environment settings, click run. This may take some time depending on the size of your area of interest. If you want to check progress, you can click ‘View Details’ at the very bottom of the Geoprocessing panel where the tool is running.\nOnce you have combined the datasets, you then need to add in the fields of interest from the individual rasters, as the combine will only show you the value fields from each raster you combined. Here’s the process for that:\n\nUse the Join Field tool in the Geoprocessing toolbox (you can search for it). This tool permanently joins the contents of one table to another based on a common attribute field (in this case, the value field of the raster). You can select which fields from the join table will be added to the input table.\nTo join in the BpS Attributes, set the input table to your combine table (in this example it’s called BpS_SClass_ADK), then set the Input Join Field to the BpS Value field (in this example, BpS_ADK – the name of my BpS layer). Set the join table as your BpS layer (here, BpS_ADK), and the Join Table Field to ‘Value’. This will match the value field from your BpS layer to the correct values in the correct field in your combine.\n\n\n\n\nBefore you hit run, it’s important to select which fields you want to join. You can do this either by Field Mapping or by Selecting Transfer Fields. This is set in the Transfer Method dropdown. In this example, I have chosen to use field mapping. With field mapping, you see a list of all the fields in the Join table (BpS) and have the option to click an x next to any field you don’t want to join. In our case, we want to join all the fields except the value field (which we already have).\n\n\nTo join in the SClass attributes, you follow the same procedure as above, but set the input Join field to the SClass value field (SClass_ADK) and the Join table to your SClass layer (SClass_ADK). I also took out most of the fields in the field mapping, because I am only interested in the label and description fields.\nWhen you are done, your combined layer should have an attribute table that includes all the attributes from your BpS layer as well as the label and description fields from your SClass layer. This will allow you to understand what proportion of each BpS is in a given succession class, as mapped by LANDFIRE.\n\n\n6.3.0.1 Screenshots for combining two rasters\n\nWhere to click to open the Geoprocessing tools.\n\n\nOpen the Combine tool\n\n\nSet the parameters\n\n\nSet the environments\n\n\nJoin Field Settings\n\n\nYour final attribute table should have all the BpS Values and the relevant SClass values"
