## Getting LANDFIRE Data from the LANDFIRE Map Viewer (LFMV)

MEGAN does this page.

## Randy's ideas

* Outline that there are multiple ways (LFMV, streaming, CONUS tifs, rlandfire package), and that this page will focus on the LFMV
* Share Jim's videos, noting that things are changing and may look a bit different than in the video
* Have directions and screenshots
    * turning off the EVT data on the initial opening page so it's easier to navigate
    * drawing a rectangle
    * how to select multiple datasets (with links to version description page)
    * reminding users to type in email, then to wait (I sometimes forget this)
    * etc.
