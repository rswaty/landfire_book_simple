# The four ways to download LANDFIRE Spatial Data


**Possible direction for this page**

## LANDFIRE provides three ways to download spatial data:

1. Using the [LANDFIRE Map Viewer](https://www.landfire.gov/viewer/)
2. Downloading CONUS, Hawaii, Alaska or insular area-wide data
3. Streaming the data with a webservice

Additionally, [Mark Buckner](https://markabuckner.com/) has created the [rlandfire](https://github.com/bcknr/rlandfire) package, which allows for direct downloading of LANDFIRE data into an R environment.

For this tutorial we will use option 1, downloading data via the LANDFIRE Map Viewer (LMV).

## Insert info on how to use LMV
